# uBlock Origin -- Experimental filters.
#
# These filters are experimental and may cause breakage. They are being
# evaluated/fine-tuned for inclusion in the default set of filters.
#
# The `important` filter option is often used here in order to ensure the
# experimental filters are used, i.e. they will override existing exception
# filters which might exist to unbreak known web page breakage.

# googletagservices.com not blocked by EasyPrivacy (I don't know why).
# This is a redirection-based filter being developed in order to be able
# to safely block `googletagservices.com` everywhere by default.

# The goal is to be able to block `www.google-analytics.com` while preventing
# web page breakage.
