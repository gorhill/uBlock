# Submitting issues

**Any issue opened without effort to provide the required details for me (or anybody else) to reproduce the problem will be closed as _invalid_.** If you provide more details thereafter for me to reproduce the issue, I will reopen it if I can confirm there is indeed an issue with uBlock Origin. Example of detailed steps:

> 1. browser version/ublock version
> 1. these settings, these filter lists, these custom filters.
> 1. do this.
> 1. open this exact URL.
> 1. do this.
> 1. observe this.
> 1. click this.
> 1. observe such and such issue
> 1. see screenshot
> 1. etc.

The most important part when opening an issue: **detailed steps**.

**Important:** I simply do not have the time to take care of filter-related issues, you will have to find help elsewhere for this. The mere need to have to respond to filter-related issues can quickly become a burden. Consider that writing code/doc occupies all my free time. Surely there are other people out there ready to help with filter-related issues, it does not have to be me.

### Before you submit

1. Submit **bugs/issues only**.
    - Bugs occur, I will fix them.
1. _One specific_ issue per submission.
1. The logger is the tool of choice to use to help diagnose issues.
1. Do **NOT**:
    - Submit design ideas.
    - Submit feature requests.
    - Submit "revolutionary ideas".
    - Post comments like "+1" or "me too!" without providing new relevant info on the issue.
    - Use issues as replacement for threads on a bulletin board. [You can use Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock+ublockorigin) for general discussion among users.
    - Any such issue will be closed without comment.
1. Make sure your issue [hasn't already been fixed in a recent release](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases).
1. Verify that the issue does **not** occur with uBlock disabled.
1. **Verify that the issue is not related to a 3rd-party filter lists.**
    - Issues with 3rd-party filter lists are the responsibility of their respective maintainers.
1. Verify that the issue is not caused by another extension.

### What to include


To help diagnose and fix the bug/issue, please always include the following in your report:

* A clear list of steps to reproduce the problem
  * **Always include a URL**, _even_ if "it happens everywhere".
* Symptoms of the issue
  * Describe what you observe and consider broken behavior; this is what we'll be looking for after executing the steps
  * Example: video doesn't start playing, page layout broken
* Include whatever relevant the logger reports.
* A screenshot or transcription of **any of uBlock's preferences that differ from the defaults**
  * This includes a whitelisted website, enabled/disabled filter list, anything
  * Please do include everything different from the defaults whether or not it seems relevant to your issue
* The version of uBlock you're having the issue with; you can find this in [uBlock's popup UI](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface)
  * Example: `uBlock 0.9.0.0`
* The browser you're using and its version
  * Examples: `Firefox 36`, `Chrome 41.0.2272` 
* The OS you're using and its version
  * Examples: `Windows 8.1`, `Linux Mint 17.1`
* A list of other extensions you have installed
  * Tip: try disabling them and see if your issue still occurs

Otherwise, we've noticed that a lot of **your** time (and the developers') gets thrown away on exchanging back and forth to get this information.
