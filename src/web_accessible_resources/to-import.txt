# This is a list of resources (by token) which will be converted to
# "web accessible resources", such that uBO will be able to redirect
# to these through moz-extension: or chrome-extension: URLs.
#
# This addresses:
# - https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3474
# - https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2823
#
# uBO attaches a "secret" token internally when redirecting to any
# "web accessible resource", such that it is not possible for a web
# page to use one of these  "web accessible resource" to directly
# detect the presence of uBO.
#
# To ensure valid filename characters on any platform OS, the filenames are
# constructed using the md5 hash of the respective tokens.
#
# In case uBO redirects to a resource which has not been converted into
# a "web accessible resource", the redirection code will fall back to
# using a data: URI.
#
# The list below was gathered manually from scanning the use of the
# "redirect=" option in uBO's own filter lists. Eventually a script could
# be written to generate the list below.
