CodeMirror is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for
the browser. It is specialized for editing code, and comes with over
100 language modes and various addons that implement more advanced
editing functionality. Every language comes with fully-featured code
and syntax highlighting to help with reading and editing complex code.

A rich programming API and a CSS theming system are available for
customizing CodeMirror to fit your application, and extending it with
new functionality.

You can find more information (and the
[manual](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html)) on the [project

### Installation

Either get the [zip file](https://codemirror.net/codemirror.zip) with
the latest version, or make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
installed and run:

    npm install codemirror

**NOTE**: This is the source repository for the library, and not the
distribution channel. Cloning it is not the recommended way to install
the library, and will in fact not work unless you also run the build
step.

### Quickstart

To build the project, make sure you have Node.js installed (at least version 6)
and then `npm install`. To run, just open `index.html` in your
browser (you don't need to run a webserver). Run the tests with `npm test`.
