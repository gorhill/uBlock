[AdNauseam](http://adnauseam.io) is a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and artware intervention to fight back against tracking by advertising networks. AdNauseam works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop uBlock-Origin) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests. At the same time, AdNauseam serves as a means of amplifying users' discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas.

We conceptualize AdNauseam within a broader class of software systems that serve ethical, political, and expressive ends. In light of the industry's failure on a Do Not Track standard, or to otherwise address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering cover against certain forms of surveillance, profiling, and practices of discrimination. Taken in this light, the software represents a similar approach to that of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot" target="_blank">TrackMeNot</a>, which attempts to relocate power in the hands of individual users, rather than vast commercial entities. For further information on this approach, please see <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/TMN-Howe-Niss08-ch23.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>.
