An efficient blocker: Easy on memory and low CPU footprint, yet able to load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.

Illustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared

Usage: The big power button in the popup permanently disables/enables uBlock for the current website. It applies to the current web site only, not other tabs or windows.

Flexible, in being more than an "ad blocker", it can also read and create filters from hosts files.

Out of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:

- EasyList
- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list
- EasyPrivacy
- Malware domains

More lists are available for you to select, should you wish to:

- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List
- Dan Pollock's hosts file
- hpHosts's Ad and tracking servers
- MVPS HOSTS
- Spam404
- And many others

Of course, the more filters are enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other popular blockers out there.

Also, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of website breakage—especially those lists which are normally used as the hosts file.
