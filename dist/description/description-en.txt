uBlock Origin (uBO) is **NOT** an "ad blocker"; it is a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as primary features.

***

Out of the box, uBO blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, etc. through the following lists of filters, enabled by default:

- EasyList (ads)
- EasyPrivacy (tracking)
- Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list
- Online Malicious URL Blocklist
- uBO owned lists

More lists are available for you to select if you wish:

- EasyList Cookie List
- Fanboy's Annoyance List
- AdGuard Annoyances
- Dan Pollock’s hosts file
- And many others

Additionally, you can point-and-click to block JavaScript locally or globally, create your own global or local rules to override entries from filter lists, and many more advanced features.

***

Free.

For users by users.

If you ever want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.
