uBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient wide-spectrum content blocker that blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, etc., using the following list of filters, enabled by default:

- EasyList (ads)
- EasyPrivacy (tracking)
- Peter Lowe's Blocklist
- Online Malicious URL Blocklist
- uBO filter lists

More lists are available for you to select if you wish:

- EasyList Cookie List
- Fanboy's Annoyance List
- AdGuard Annoyances
- Dan Pollockâ€™s hosts file
- And many others

Additionally, you can point-and-click to block JavaScript locally or globally, create your own global or local rules to override entries from filter lists, and many more advanced features.

Free. Open source with public license (GPLv3). For users by users. No donations sought.

If you ever want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.
