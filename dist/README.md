## INSTALL

#### Chromium

- Download and unzip `ublock0.chromium.zip` ([latest release desirable](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases)).
- Rename the unzipped directory to `ublock`
    - When you later update manually, replace the **content** of the `ublock` folder with the **content** of the latest zipped version.
    - This will ensure that all the extension settings will be preserved
    - As long as the extension loads **from same folder path from which it was originally installed**, all your settings will be preserved.
- Go to chromium/chrome *Extensions*.
- Click to check *Developer mode*.
- Click *Load unpacked extension...*.
- In the file selector dialog:
    - Select the directory `ublock` which was created above.
    - Click *Open*.

The extension will now be available in your chromium/chromium-based browser.

##### Chromium Build Instructions (for developers)

- Clone [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) repositories in the same parent directory
- Set path to uBlock: `cd uBlock`
- Optional: Select the version to build: `git checkout <tag>`
- Build the plugin: `./tools/make-chromium.sh`
- Load the unpacked extension folder `/uBlock/dist/build/uBlock0.chromium/` in Chromium to use the extension


Remember that you have to update manually also. For some users, updating manually is actually an advantage because:
- You can update when **you** want
- If ever a new version sucks, you can easily just re-install the previous one

#### Firefox

- Download `ublock0.firefox.xpi` ([latest release desirable](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases)). 
- Drag and drop the previously downloaded `ublock0.firefox.xpi` into Firefox

Your uBlock Origin settings are kept intact even after you uninstall the addon.

On Linux, the settings are saved in a SQlite file located at `~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile name]/extension-data/ublock0.sqlite`.

On Windows, the settings are saved in a SQlite file located at `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile name]\extension-data\ublock0.sqlite`.
