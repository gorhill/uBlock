## INSTALL

#### Safari

- Download `uBlock0.safariextz` ([latest release desirable](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock/releases))
- Open the downloaded extension
- In Safari's popup:
    - Click *Trust*

For now, when installing manually, updates will not show up in Safari's extensions panel. 
Therefore, you will have to repeat this process to update. For some users, updating manually is actually an advantage because:
- You can update when **you** want
- If ever a new version sucks, you can easily just re-install the previous one

##### Troubleshooting

If clicking *Trust* [does not work](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/issues/6), you may [need to use keyboard controls](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/57442/safari-extensions-dont-install-but-no-error-message):

> 1. Launch **System Preferences** and open the **Keyboard** pane.
> 1. Switch to the **Shortcuts** tab.
> 1. Toggle **All Controls** to selected.
> 1. Re-attempt to install the extension and use the `Tab` key on the keyboard to highlight **Trust**.
> 1. Press the `Space bar` key to press the **Trust** button once selected.
