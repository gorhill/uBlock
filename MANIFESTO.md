### This is uBlock's manifesto

1. The **user decides** when websites get money for their services.

The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' _"Acceptable Ads Manifesto"_,
because the _"Acceptable Ads"_ marketing campaign suggests that websites can
set terms of service with their customers, and that Google is not my personal army 
to demand web pages from.

Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. Instead of
not using these sites that host "unacceptable" content, uBlock's
sole purpose is to give users the means to use their services *and* refuse to follow
explicit or implicit agreements to watch ads out of some half-baked sense of entitlement.
